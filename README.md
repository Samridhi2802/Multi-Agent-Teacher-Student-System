# Multi-Agent-Teacher-Student-System
This project demonstrates a sophisticated multi-agent system built using Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK), simulating a dynamic learning environment. It showcases a collaborative conversational flow between AI agents with distinct roles: a Teacher, a Student, and a Root Agent orchestrating their interaction.
